Dear Friends:
Thank you for attending our meeting last Friday and your support of this special networking group. 
Here are some updates based on our discussions on Oct 25:
1.	“RIT International Faculty Networking Group” is available in MyCourses for you to use.  I have also created a section entitled “Member Introduction” Please find time to add your information (Attached is a power point template for your reference. You are free to use any kind of format you prefer to introduce yourself). Please also feel free to add colleagues who are interested in joining our group to the class list. 
 
2.	Dilin, Zhijian, and Mohamed will work together to pursue the mentoring grant (due Nov 4). The maximum amount of funding they can request is $2,000. The cost of hospitality cannot be more than 10% of the requested funding. If you have any exceptional speakers you would like to bring to our campus to speak to our group, please email the information to Dilin, Zhijian, and Mohamed ASAP. 
 
3.	Provost’s Leadership Opportunity Grant application is due Nov 4. The best way to increase our visibility on campus is to occupy some leadership roles at RIT. This sort of leadership training is very beneficial to the development of self-confidence as well as leadership skill. Please consider applying for this grant (please see https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/facultydevelopment/provosts-leadership-opportunity-grant-plog) 
 
4.	Michael made some great suggestions regarding how our group can support RIT Global in terms of developing partnerships with universities from our home countries with regard to student or faculty exchange programs, faculty-led study abroad program, and even international student recruitment for RIT. I will seek an auspicious time to invite Dr. James Myers to speak to our group and to generate ideas.  
                                         
5.	It has been suggested that each of us contribute $20 to the group to establish a fund to support the cost of hosting social events. If there are no objections, we can start collecting dues at our next meeting. I am looking for a volunteer to be the treasurer of our networking group. If you are interested in being our treasurer, please let me know.  
 
6.	Our next “meeting” (The Holiday Party) has been scheduled for 3:30pm, Tuesday, December 10 (Reading Day) in Henry’s (4F Eastman). Please mark your calendar! I will be sending a RSVP link as we approach the party date.  
 
Thanks again for your continuing support of this networking group! I am sure our RIT experiences will be made richer with the companionship of great friends! Way to go, RIT International Faculty! 
