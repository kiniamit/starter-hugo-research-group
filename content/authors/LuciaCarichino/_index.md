Before joining RIT, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I earned a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree in Mathematical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano in Italy, and a PhD in Mathematics from Purdue University.

The focus of my research is on mathematical and computational models of multiscale biological systems including fluid-structure interaction. I am excited by the potential of using mathematical models that describe the physical phenomena governing biological systems in synergy with experimental data to elucidate the mechanisms behind a biological process, ultimately aiding the future development of medicine. I enjoy teaching, I strive to establish a classroom environment where the students are challenged to ask questions and share ideas without the concern of making mistakes.
