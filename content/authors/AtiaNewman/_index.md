Atia Newman (Quadri) is an award-winning international 3D animator with roots in Pakistan. She is one of the first women to ever work in the Pakistani animation industry. Hired as a 2D animator straight out of school, she made the shift into 3D animation when she discovered the added challenge of combining technology with the aesthetic value of animation art.
