My passion is working on interdisciplinary projects that aim to leverage the quality of life for people with different abilities, educational levels, and age groups. I worked in academia in Egypt and USA. My PhD is from Virginia Tech.

As a researcher, I develop research ideas, direct teams, write winning grants, and publish papers. I am a co-inventor of a pending US patent.

As a university professor, I teach undergraduate and graduate courses, and serve the community. My ultimate goal is to support female computing students in achieving their career goals while having a healthy social life.
