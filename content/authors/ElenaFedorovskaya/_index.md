Professor in the School of Media Sciences, Rochester Institute of Technology, with the focus on teaching and research in the area of human-media interaction, trans-media publishing and their effects on the user.
Inventive Research Scientist in Imaging, Human Vision, Human Centered Computing and User Experience with over 15 years of experience in leading and executing R&D projects in a technology and consumer product industry. Unique background in cognitive science/psychology, mathematics and imaging science, with broad multidisciplinary knowledge and practical research experience. Known for formulating novel human-centered technology and system concepts, resulting in more than 40 U.S. patents in areas related to digital imaging, display systems and health care markets. International breadth of research and collaboration experience. Ability to quickly learn new skills and technology domains. Hands-on knowledge of a vast toolbox of research methods for human-centered research: lab experiments, usability studies, clinical trials, field studies, interviewing, surveys, eye tracking and physiological recording.

I am interested in teaching, performing research, mentoring and consulting in the area of research, development and commercialization that involves understanding and modeling human behavior and interaction with novel imaging and media systems.
